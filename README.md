Hangman Game

This is a nice Python project idea simulating the Hangman word guessing game. We used a predefined list of words for the guessing aspect, but feel free to improve it using a third-party dictionary API.

This Python project uses loops, functions, and string formatting to print the hangman's progress. We can also experiment with the modules of the standard library random, time and os.
